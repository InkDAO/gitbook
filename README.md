# Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/dX_background.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

decentralizedX (dX) is a Web3-powered content publishing platform that enables creators to publish premium content and monetize it directly through blockchain technology. Built on Ethereum and IPFS, dX provides a censorship-resistant, decentralized infrastructure for content creators to share their work and earn from their audience without intermediaries.

## What makes decentralizedX unique?

* **True Ownership**: Content is stored on IPFS with private access control. Only subscribers get lifetime access to your content through blockchain-verified ownership.
* **Direct Monetization**: Creators set their own prices and keep 95% of revenue. Only 5% goes to platform infrastructure (servers, IPFS hosting, deployment). Payments go directly to creator wallets via smart contracts.
* **Wallet-Based Identity**: No signup, no email, no personal data. Your wallet address is your identity, providing both privacy and accountability.
* **Decentralized Storage**: Content stored on IPFS ensures permanence and censorship resistance. Your content can't be taken down by any central authority.
* **Transparent & Trustless**: All transactions and ownership records are immutably stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring complete transparency.
* **Rich Content Creation**: Built-in editor supports text, images, code, embeds, and more, providing a complete content creation experience.

## How It Works

1. **Create**: Write and format your content using our rich text editor
2. **Publish**: Upload to IPFS (private) and publish metadata to blockchain
3. **Monetize**: Set your own price (including free) for each post
4. **Earn**: Subscribers pay once for lifetime access, directly to your wallet

# Posts

Anyone can create a post on dX by providing the following metadata:

* Title – A concise summary of the question.
* Body – A detailed description or context.

Once submitted, the post becomes publicly visible on the homepage for 7 days. After 7 days, the post is marked as archived—it is removed from the homepage but remains accessible on the Archive page. This approach keeps the homepage dynamic and focused on fresh content while preserving older discussions permanently.

All posts and comments are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency, censorship resistance, and immutability. Once your voice is published, it becomes a permanent part of Web3 history.

The 7 day duration for posts is configurable and can be changed by admin as per needs.

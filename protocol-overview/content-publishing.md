# Content Publishing

Content publishing on decentralizedX turns your knowledge into permanent digital assets. Unlike traditional platforms that control your content and take large cuts, decentralizedX gives creators ownership and 95% of revenue (5% covers platform infrastructure like servers, IPFS hosting, and deployment costs).

## What Makes Posts Different?

Think of a post like a digital book that you publish and sell directly to your audience. Unlike Medium where the platform takes control, or YouTube that keeps 45% of earnings, decentralizedX takes only 5% for infrastructure—giving creators 95%. When Sarah publishes a smart contract guide, she's creating a permanent digital asset stored on IPFS, recorded on blockchain, priced however she wants—whether free for beginners or $50 for advanced content.

## The Three Phases

**Draft**: Marcus saves his Web3 security guide privately on IPFS. He can edit it as many times as needed until it's perfect. No pressure, no deadlines—just him and his content.

**Published**: Marcus publishes to the blockchain. His post becomes a unique digital asset with its own smart contract. He sets the price at 0.05 ETH ($100), adds a thumbnail and description, and it's permanent. The blockchain proves Marcus wrote it and when.

**Purchased**: When Elena buys Marcus's guide for 0.05 ETH, 95% (0.0475 ETH) goes to Marcus's wallet and 5% (0.0025 ETH) goes to platform infrastructure. She receives ERC20 tokens proving her ownership. Her access never expires—she owns it forever, not just renting it.

## Public vs Private Content

DecentralizedX balances discovery with privacy cleverly. Everyone can see post titles, descriptions, thumbnails, prices, and how many people purchased. This helps readers decide if content is worth the price. But the actual content—the detailed explanations, code examples, and methodologies—remains private on IPFS, accessible only to the creator and those who bought it.

## Who Benefits?

**Knowledge Entrepreneurs** like Priya publish DeFi analysis, building an audience of 500 subscribers and earning 14.25 ETH ($28,500) after the 5% platform fee (which covers infrastructure costs).

**Technical Educators** like James publish free beginner content to build reputation, then charge 0.02-0.05 ETH for intermediate and advanced tutorials. Students get lifetime access.

**Researchers** like Dr. Chen publish early findings for 0.1 ETH, giving investors a competitive edge before public release months later.

**Community Builders** like Alex use free content to attract thousands of readers, occasionally publishing premium analysis that dedicated supporters purchase.

## Direct Creator-Reader Relationship

When Miguel buys a post about Layer 2 solutions for 0.03 ETH, 95% (0.0285 ETH) goes directly to the creator and 5% (0.0015 ETH) covers platform infrastructure. The blockchain records everything, tokens prove Miguel's access, and both parties get what they want—immediately. No algorithm decides what gets promoted, no ads distract from value, just straightforward exchange: create something useful, price it fairly, get paid when people find it valuable.

## The Role of Free Content

Not everything costs money. Creators set prices to 0 ETH for strategic reasons: new creators build reputation, established creators demonstrate ongoing expertise, and everyone contributes to a thriving knowledge ecosystem. Free content is truly free—no email signup, no credit card, no hidden costs. If the price is 0, anyone can access it immediately.

## Why This Matters

This model creates a knowledge economy where quality naturally rises because valuable content earns more, encouraging creators to produce more quality. Readers make intentional purchases based on value, not impulse decisions based on subscription lock-in. The relationship is direct, transparent, and mutually beneficial—ownership is clear, payments are immediate, and value flows to those who create it.

# Announcements

The Announcements page serves as the official communication channel for platform administrators. This section is crucial for keeping users informed about important updates and changes to the protocol.

## Purpose

* **Protocol Updates**: Stay informed about new features, improvements, and technical changes to the platform.
* **Important Changes**: Receive notifications about significant modifications to platform policies or functionality.
* **Community Feedback**: Participate in shaping the platform's future by providing feedback on proposed updates and changes.

## Key Features

* **Admin-Only Posts**: Only platform administrators can create announcement posts, ensuring the authenticity of official communications.
* **Permanent Record**: All announcements are stored immutably on-chain, creating a transparent and verifiable history of platform changes.
* **Public Access**: Anyone can view announcements to stay up-to-date with platform developments.

## How It Works

Announcements are created by administrators and remain permanently visible on the Announcements page. Unlike regular posts, announcements are not archived after 30 days and serve as a permanent reference for important platform information.

If you have questions about any announcement, feel free to discuss them on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/decentralizedX0).

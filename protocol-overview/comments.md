# Comments

Any user can submit a comment to any posts (active/archived). To contribute, the user simply needs to provide the comment body—no account, personal information, or sign-up is required.

All submitted comments are permanently recorded on-chain and displayed under their respective posts. This ensures full transparency and immutability:

* Visibility – Comments are publicly accessible and remain linked to the question for reference.
* Permanence – Once submitted, comments cannot be edited or deleted by anyone, including the original contributor or administrators.

This design guarantees that all contributions are preserved in their original form, promoting trust and accountability in community-driven discourse.

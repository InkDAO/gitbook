# Challenges

* **Spam Protection**: Prevent spammy or low-quality posts and comments while maintaining the platform’s open and anonymous nature.
* **Incentivize Engagement**: Introduce ways to reward early users for contributing high-quality posts and comments. This could include on-chain badges, recognition, or future token-based incentives to encourage genuine engagement and build a loyal community from the start.
* **Long-Term Storage Costs**: Addressing the cost of storing all data immutably on-chain, especially for high volumes of posts and comments.

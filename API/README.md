# API Documentation

The dX API works in conjunction with smart contracts and IPFS to enable a complete Web3 content publishing and monetization platform. It provides the necessary backend infrastructure for content storage, authentication, and access control while maintaining decentralization principles.

### Architecture

This API is powered by **Edge Functions**, a serverless computing architecture that runs code on globally distributed edge nodes close to end users. By deploying on Netlify's Edge Functions with the Deno runtime, the platform delivers ultra-low latency responses (typically under 50ms), automatic scaling to handle traffic spikes, and zero cold-start delays.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Netlify Edge Functions**: Serverless deployment with global edge network distribution
- **Hono Framework**: Ultrafast web framework optimized for edge computing environments
- **Pinata**: Enterprise-grade IPFS pinning service for decentralized file storage
- **Ethers.js v6**: Industry-standard library for Ethereum blockchain interaction

### Key Features & Benefits

#### 1. Passwordless Authentication
**Technique**: Ethereum wallet signature-based authentication using EIP-191 standard

**Benefits:**
- No passwords to remember or manage
- Cryptographically secure authentication
- Users maintain full control of their identity
- Seamless Web3 integration

#### 2. Decentralized File Storage
**Technique**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) with Pinata pinning service

**Benefits:**
- Content-addressed storage (files identified by content hash)
- Censorship-resistant and tamper-proof
- No single point of failure
- Global content distribution

#### 3. JWT Token Session Management
**Technique**: JSON Web Tokens with 2-hour expiration

**Benefits:**
- Stateless authentication (no server-side session storage)
- Scalable across distributed systems
- Automatic token expiration for enhanced security
- Easy to implement client-side token management

#### 4. Blockchain-based Access Control
**Technique**: ERC20 token ownership verification via smart contracts

**Benefits:**
- Transparent and auditable access rules
- Programmable access control logic
- Transferable access rights
- No centralized access control server
- Native cryptocurrency payment integration

#### 5. Webhook Event System
**Technique**: HMAC-SHA256 signed webhooks from Alchemy and QuickNode

**Benefits:**
- Real-time blockchain event notifications
- Automatic status synchronization
- Cryptographically verified event authenticity
- Reliable delivery with built-in retry mechanisms

#### 6. Two-tier File System
**Technique**: Status-based file lifecycle (pending â†’ onchain)

**Benefits:**
- Draft files can be modified before publishing
- Published files are immutable and blockchain-backed
- Cost-effective (only publish finalized content on-chain)

#### 7. Private IPFS Gateway
**Technique**: Pinata's private gateway with access control

**Benefits:**
- Content remains on IPFS but access is controlled
- Fast content delivery via CDN
- Compatible with standard IPFS ecosystem

### Security Features

The API implements multiple layers of security to ensure data integrity and user protection:

1. **Cryptographic Authentication**: All authentication uses Ethereum's battle-tested signature algorithms
2. **HMAC Webhook Verification**: Webhooks are validated using SHA-256 cryptographic signatures
3. **Ownership Verification**: All file operations verify ownership through smart contracts or metadata
4. **Automatic Token Expiration**: JWT tokens expire after 2 hours to limit exposure window

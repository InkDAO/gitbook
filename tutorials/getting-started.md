# Getting Started

Welcome to InkDAO! You can browse posts and read free content without any setup, but you'll need a wallet to create posts, purchase content, or monetize your work.

## Browsing InkDAO (No Wallet Required)
- Visit [InkDAO](https://inkdao.tech/)
- Browse all posts on the homepage
- View post metadata (title, description, thumbnail, price)
- Read free posts (posts with 0 ETH price)
- Filter by "All Posts" or "Free Posts"
- Search posts by title

## Setting Up Your Wallet

To create, publish, or purchase content, you'll need a crypto wallet. Here's how:

### 1. Install a Wallet
InkDAO supports multiple wallets through RainbowKit. We recommend:

**MetaMask** (Most Popular):
1. Visit [MetaMask's official website](https://metamask.io/)
2. Click "Download" and select your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc.)
3. Click "Add to Browser" and follow the installation prompts
4. Once installed, click the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar

**Other Options**:
- Coinbase Wallet
- WalletConnect-compatible wallets
- Rainbow Wallet

### 2. Create Your Wallet
1. Click "Create a new wallet"
2. Create a strong password (store it safely!)
3. Watch the secret recovery phrase video
4. Write down your 12-word secret recovery phrase
   - **CRITICAL**: Store this phrase securely offline
   - Never share it with anyone
   - Never store it digitally (no screenshots, no cloud storage)
   - This is your only backup if you lose access to your wallet

### 3. Get Test ETH (Sepolia Network)
InkDAO currently runs on the Sepolia testnet for testing purposes.

1. Copy your wallet address from your wallet
2. Visit a Sepolia faucet:
   - [Google Cloud Sepolia Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)
   - [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
   - [Chainlink Sepolia Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)
3. Paste your address and request test ETH
4. Wait 1-5 minutes for the test ETH to arrive in your wallet

**Note**: Test ETH has no real value. It's only used for testing on the Sepolia network.

### 4. Connect to InkDAO
1. Visit [InkDAO](https://inkdao.tech/)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" button in the top right
3. Select your wallet from the options
4. Approve the connection request in your wallet
5. You may be asked to sign a message for authentication (no gas fees)

**Note**: Currently, published posts cannot be edited. Make sure your content is final before publishing.

## Understanding Transactions & Gas Fees

### When You Pay Gas Fees:
1. **Publishing a post**: Writing metadata to blockchain
2. **Purchasing a post**: Buying access tokens
3. **Any blockchain writes**: All on-chain transactions

### Free Operations (No Gas):
1. Browsing posts
2. Reading free content
3. Saving drafts
4. Wallet connection
5. Authentication signatures

## What's Next?

After setting up:
1. Explore existing content on the platform
2. Create your first post (try a free one first)
3. Purchase some content to see the reader experience
4. Join the community on Telegram
5. Share feedback and suggestions

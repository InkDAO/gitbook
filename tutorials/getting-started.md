## Creating Posts & Comments
To create posts or leave comments, you'll need to set up a wallet. Here's how:

### 1. Install MetaMask

### 2. Create Your Wallet

2. Create a strong password (store it safely!)
3. Watch the secret recovery phrase video
4. Write down your 12-word secret recovery phrase
   - **IMPORTANT**: Store this phrase securely offline
   - Never share it with anyone
   - This is your only backup if you lose access to your wallet

### 3. Get Test ETH

2. Visit a Sepolia faucet (e.g., [Sepolia Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia))
3. Paste your address and request test ETH
4. Wait a few minutes for the test ETH to arrive in your wallet

### 4. Connect to dX

# Creating Your First Post

This tutorial will walk you through creating and publishing your first post on InkDAO. By the end, you'll have published content that can be monetized through blockchain-based subscriptions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- ✅ A crypto wallet installed (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
- ✅ Connected your wallet to InkDAO
- ✅ Some sepolia ETH in your wallet (for gas fees)
- ✅ Authenticated with your wallet signature

If you haven't completed these steps, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md) first.

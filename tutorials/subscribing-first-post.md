## Understanding Subscriptions

### What is a Subscription?
On decentralizedX, a "subscription" is a one-time purchase that grants you **lifetime access** to a post:
- **One-time payment**: Pay once, access forever
- **Token ownership**: You receive ERC20 tokens representing your access
- **No expiration**: Access never expires
- **Transferable**: You can transfer or sell your access tokens

### Free vs Paid Content
- **Free posts (0 ETH)**: Accessible to everyone without purchase
- **Paid posts**: Require one-time payment for access
- **Preview available**: You can always see title, description, and thumbnail before buying
